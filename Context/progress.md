- Branches: 0% ‚Üí maintaining quality assertions

**Frontend:**

- Cypress/component tests: Pending API integration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Risks & Mitigations

**1. MercadoPago API Changes:** Monitor changelog, implement webhook signature validation always

**2. Email Delivery Limits:** Start with Gmail SMTP limits, migrate to SendGrid when volume increases

**3. Social Media API Deprecation:** Choose stable endpoints, implement fallback mechanisms

**4. Database Scaling:** Design with future sharding in mind, avoid premature optimization

**5. Fraud Prevention:** IP rate limiting, suspicious pattern detection on donations
