## Style Guidelines:

- Headline font: 'Belleza', sans-serif, for a friendly, approachable look, especially for the fashion, art and design elements related to the solidarity fairs. Body Font: 'Alegreya', serif, will ensure readability, particularly in sections explaining the organization's work and impact.
- Use simple, empathetic icons to represent the different services offered, ensuring clarity and ease of navigation.
- The layout should be clean and intuitive, focusing on clear calls to action, especially for donations and volunteer sign-ups.
- Primary color: Soft coral pink (#E67C73) represents care, empathy, and the fight against cancer (linked to the pink ribbon).
- Secondary color: Light mint green (#A8E6CF) conveys freshness, healing, and hope. It contrasts well with pink without losing warmth.
- Neutral color: Light stone gray (#F5F5F5) maintains visual cleanliness, legibility, and professionalism.
